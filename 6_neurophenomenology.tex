   %Model features (simplicity, breadth, and accuracy) vs. neurophenomenology in KT. The panel displays objective model aspects, i.e., how simple/short the model/program is, how much data from input/output interfaces of the agent it tries to account for, and how well it matches data; and how these dimensions map into the level of \SEP (called awareness in the colorbar).
